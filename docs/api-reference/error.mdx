## Error Codes

- 2xx codes indicate success. For example, a 200 OK code indicates that the request was successful.
- 4xx codes indicate an error that was caused by the client. For example, a 400 Bad Request code indicates that the request was malformed.
- 5xx codes indicate an error that was caused by the server. For example, a 500 Internal Server Error code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected error.
