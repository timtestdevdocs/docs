## Overview

The Object Detection API allows you to identify and locate objects within images. It can detect various types of objects and optionally provide GUI elements for user interface components.

## Request Parameters

### Body

<ParamField body="url" type="string">
  The URL of the image to analyze. Required if `file_store_key` is not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="file_store_key" type="string">
  The key of a previously uploaded image in Jigsawstack file storage. Required if `url` is not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="prompts" type="string[]">
  Optional array of specific prompts to guide the object detection process.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="features" type="string[]">
  Array specifying which features to include in the response. Possible values:
  - `object_detection`: Detect general objects in the image
  - `gui`: Detect GUI elements in the image
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="annotated_image" type="boolean">
  If true, the API will return an annotated version of the image with detected objects outlined.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="return_type" type="string">
  Specifies the format for returned image data. Possible values:
  - `url`: Return a URL to the annotated image
  - `base64`: Return the annotated image as a base64-encoded string
</ParamField>

<Info>Either `url` or `file_store_key` must be provided, but not both.</Info>

## Response Structure

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the call was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="annotated_image" type="string">
  URL or base64 string of the annotated image, if requested. Only included if `annotated_image` is true and objects or GUI elements are detected.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gui_elements" type="array">
  Array of detected GUI elements, only included if `features` includes "gui".
  <Expandable title="GUI Element Structure">
    <ResponseField name="bounds" type="object">
      Bounding box coordinates of the GUI element.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="content" type="string">
      Text content of the GUI element, if any.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="objects" type="array">
  Array of detected objects, only included if `features` includes "object_detection".
  <Expandable title="Detected Object Structure">
    <ResponseField name="bounds" type="object">
      Bounding box coordinates of the detected object.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="mask" type="string">
      URL or base64 string of the object's mask, if available.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="_usage" type="object">
  Optional usage statistics for the API call.
</ResponseField>

## Usage Examples

### Basic Object Detection

```javascript
const response = await jigsaw.vision.object_detection({
  url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  features: ["object_detection"]
});
```

### GUI Element Detection with Annotated Image

```javascript
const response = await jigsaw.vision.object_detection({
  file_store_key: "uploaded_screenshot.png",
  features: ["gui"],
  annotated_image: true,
  return_type: "url"
});
```

### Combined Object and GUI Detection

```javascript
const response = await jigsaw.vision.object_detection({
  url: "https://example.com/ui_screenshot.png",
  features: ["object_detection", "gui"],
  prompts: ["Identify all clickable elements"],
  annotated_image: true,
  return_type: "base64"
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Use high-quality images for better detection accuracy.
2. Specify `features` to focus on the types of elements you're interested in.
3. Use `prompts` to guide the detection process for specific use cases.
4. Consider using `annotated_image` for visual debugging or user interfaces.
