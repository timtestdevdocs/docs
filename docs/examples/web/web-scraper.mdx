## Overview

The AI Web Scraper API allows you to extract specific information from any website using natural language prompts. Unlike traditional web scrapers that require complex CSS selectors or XPath expressions, our AI-powered scraper lets you describe what data you want in plain English, then intelligently extracts it from the page.

- Extract data using simple natural language prompts
- No need for complex selectors, XPath, or DOM knowledge
- Works with dynamic websites and JavaScript-rendered content
- Handles various data structures (text, lists, tables)
- Adapts to changing website layouts

## API Endpoint

```
POST /v1/ai/scrape
```

## Quick Start

```javascript Javascript
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

  url: "https://news.ycombinator.com",
  element_prompts: ["post_titles", "post_points", "post_username"],
});

console.log(response);

## Writing Effective Prompts

The quality of your element prompts significantly affects extraction accuracy. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "price", use "current sale price" or "subscription price per month"
2. **Provide context**: Use "number of rooms available" instead of just "number"
3. **Specify format when needed**: "Release date in YYYY-MM-DD format" or "price in USD"
4. **Clarify structure**: "List of ingredients" indicates you expect an array return


## Advanced Example

```javascript Handling Dynamic Content
const response = await jigsaw.web.ai_scrape({
  url: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoeven/",
  element_prompts: ["full_name", "current_job_title", "current_company"],
  selectors: ["div.not-first-middot > span:nth-child(1)"],
});
```

### Response

```json
{
  "context": {
    "full_name": [
      "Yoeven D Khemlani"
    ],
    "current_job_title": [
      "Founder at JigsawStack 🧩"
    ],
    "current_company": [
      "JigsawStack"
    ],
    "div.not-first-middot > span:nth-child(1)": [
      "3K followers"
    ]
  }
  ....
}
```
