- Detailed emotion detection with sentence-level analysis
- Contextual understanding of language
- Support for multiple languages
- High accuracy with natural language

## API Endpoint

```
POST /v1/ai/sentiment
```

## Quick Start

```javascript Javascript
import { JigsawStack } from 'jigsawstack';

const jigsaw = new JigsawStack('your-api-key');

const response = await jigsaw.ai.sentiment({
  text: "The customer service was excellent, and I really enjoyed the product!"
});

console.log(response);
```

## Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sentiment": {
    "emotion": "happiness",
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "score": 0.92,
    "sentences": [
      {
        "text": "The customer service was excellent,",
        "emotion": "satisfaction",
        "sentiment": "positive",
        "score": 0.90
      },
      {
        "text": "and I really enjoyed the product!",
        "emotion": "happiness",
        "sentiment": "positive",
        "score": 0.94
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Optimizing Sentiment Analysis

For best results with the Sentiment Analysis API:

1. **Provide sufficient context**: Longer text with complete context generally produces more accurate sentiment analysis than short, fragmented content
2. **Consider language nuances**: The API handles various languages and cultural expressions, but providing clear, well-structured text improves accuracy
3. **Use sentence-level analysis**: The API automatically breaks down text into sentences, allowing you to identify sentiment shifts within a single piece of content
4. **Optimal length**: Aim for 10-100 words for best results (maximum 5000 characters per request)

## Example

```javascript Customer Feedback Analyzer
// Example: Analyze customer feedback
async function analyzeCustomerFeedback(feedbackText) {
  const response = await jigsaw.ai.sentiment({
    text: feedbackText
  });
  
  // Find the most negative sentence
  const mostNegativeSentence = response.sentiment.sentences.reduce(
    (mostNegative, current) => {
      if (current.sentiment === "negative" && 
          (mostNegative === null || current.score < mostNegative.score)) {
        return current;
      }
      return mostNegative;
    }, 
    null
  );
  
  return {
    overallSentiment: response.sentiment.sentiment,
    overallScore: response.sentiment.score,
    mostNegativeAspect: mostNegativeSentence ? mostNegativeSentence.text : null
  };
}

// Usage
const feedback = "Overall I liked the product. However, the shipping was delayed by two weeks. The customer service was helpful in resolving the issue.";
const analysis = await analyzeCustomerFeedback(feedback);
console.log(analysis);
```
